#summary Installation of the jscsscomp
#labels Featured,Phase-Deploy

==Install==
1. get archive with jscsscomp

2. extract archive somethere on your disc

3. copy `jscsscomp` folder to the document root of your site

5. `jscsscomp/cache/` dir should be writable for your scripts (or caching will not work)

6. add this code to the .htaccess file
{{{
RewriteEngine on
	
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -f
RewriteRule ^(.*\.)(js|css)$ jscsscomp/jscsscomp.php?q=$1$2 [L,NC]
}}}
or simply copy one from the distribution

From this point all your JS and CSS files should be served compressed by gzip (if browser accepts gzip compression) or by [http://dean.edwards.name/packer/ packer] (only for JS files)

==One file trick==
(this part is copied from [http://www.hunlock.com/blogs/Supercharged_Javascript here])

If you use a lot of JS (or CSS) files

{{{
<!-- Namespace source file -->  
<script src = "yahoo.js" ></script> 
 
<!-- Dependency source files -->  
<script src = "dom.js" ></script> 
<script src = "event.js" ></script> 
<script src = "effects/dragdrop.js" ></script> 
 
<!-- Slider source file -->  
<script src = "slider.js" ></script>    
}}}

you can get all this files (compressed!) in one request: 

{{{
<script src = "/jscsscomp/yahoo.js, dom.js, event.js, effects/dragdrop.js, slider.js"></script>
}}}

==Doing without ModRewrite==
If mod-rewrite is not installed, or you can't use it write URLs in this way:

{{{
<script src = "/jscsscomp/jscsscomp.php?q=dom.js" ></script> 

<script src = "/jscsscomp/jscsscomp.php?q=yahoo.js, event.js, effects/dragdrop.js, slider.js"></script>
}}}
